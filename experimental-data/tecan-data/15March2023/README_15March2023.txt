Smono in acetate or glucose
 
Phi + P22 in glucose, Phi, P22 or Phi + P22 in acetate

OD600 and PFUS

OD600 data for 10 resistant Smono isolates in glucose from well B8 (replicate B2) in first run tested with either Phi or P22

OD600 data for 3 resistant Smono isolates (R2, R4, R8) from well B8, tested along with ancestral S challenged with either Phi, P22 or Phi + P22

initial-tecan --> initial Smono tecan in acetate or glucose

b2-resistant-isolates --> resistant Smono isolates from initial tecan well B8 challenged with phage

resistant-isolates-with-ancestral --> R2, R4, R8 resistant isolates from initial tecan well B8 challenged with phage, plus 6 wells with no cells to test phage degradation rates
